# Booki Book Recommendation System

Booki is a book recommendation system designed to provide personalized book recommendations based on user preferences and interests. This project utilizes various technologies, including C#, ASP .NET Core, Python, Spacy, Ontology, and knowledge base graphs.

## Project Overview

The Booki Book Recommendation System aims to help users discover new books that align with their reading preferences. The system employs advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques, a knowledge base graph, and AI algorithms to analyze user input and generate tailored recommendations.

## Features

- User Registration and Authentication: Users can create accounts, log in, and access personalized book recommendations based on their interests.
- Book Search: Users can search for books by title, author, genre, or any other relevant criteria.
- Personalized Recommendations: The system suggests books based on user preferences, reading history, and other contextual factors.
- Ontology-based AI: The project utilizes ontologies to model the relationships between books, authors, genres, and other relevant entities.
- NLP Processing: Natural language processing techniques are employed to extract meaningful information from user queries and improve the accuracy of recommendations.
- Knowledge Base Graph: The system leverages a knowledge base graph to store and represent book-related data, enabling efficient querying and inference.

## Technologies Used

- C#: Used for the frontend and backend development of the web application.
- ASP .NET Core: Framework used to build the web application and provide server-side functionality.
- Python: Utilized for implementing the AI components, including NLP processing and recommendation algorithms.
- Spacy: Python library used for advanced natural language processing tasks.
- Ontology: Used to model and represent book-related data and relationships.
- Knowledge Base Graph: Utilized for efficient storage and querying of book-related information.
